 Ok so the scripts might be like insane and not like a pro (im kinda stupid)

 its hard to explain how i set things up they just kinda make sense to me. But Local Scripts are is the file that i put scripts that other scripts inherent or Game Manager / any manager. And the Scripts folder has all the other scripts

 the main one I KNOW uses for loops + foreach loops is the CraftingManager.cs in the checkAllRecipes void. Its probably not the right way to do that AT all but good luck trying to read my code. its been a couple of months since i worked on it so idek whats in it.(probably a bunch of stuff i didnt fix/takeout)


sorry if its unreadable
